This document was spawned by FileMaker HTML, version 1.0

Information on FileMaker HTML, version 1.0:
FileMaker HTML, version 1.0, is, as the name suggests, a script that is used to spawn HTML documents. Version 1.0 was the first in development, and therefore its functionality is very limited, currently only towards headers and paragraphs. In later releases of FileMaker HTML, support for other elements (even dynamic ones) will be added, and the user will be able to link up external stylesheets and scripts.

<title>FileMaker</title><body><h1>What is FileMaker?</h1><p>FileMaker hopes to offer spawning support for any kind of file: From simple text files to beatiful webpages, and even spawning light code, FileMaker can simplify your day.</p><h1>Our current status:</h1><p>We started quite recently (3/2/15), so we currently do not offer the best of support, and our only release is a version that spawns and edits basic HTML files (FilerMaker HTML was responsible for the creation of this document).</p><p>We might not have any really good releases, but we're working really hard behind the scenes to make newer versions of FileMaker.</p><h1>Applications in real life:</h1><p>FileMaker can be applied a lot in real life. For instance, consider yourself head of a company, and you need a good website. FileMaker will help your organization or corporation by creating these files for you.</p><p>If you're not happy with the support that FileMaker offers, don't worry. In future releases, FileMaker will have a "compatibility mode" in which source code of the file is laid out so that anyone can read and edit it.</p><h1>FileMaker Education</h1><p>FileMaker will soon offer education for its customers. This education will offer tutorials on how to use FileMaker, different configuration settings of FileMaker, and how to fully unlock FileMaker's potential.</p><p>FileMaker education will be offered to anyone, even those who are not our customers. Our customers, however, get additional education, and access to documents not available to the public.</p>
