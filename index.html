		<h3>Current Progress:</h3>
		<p>Since we started quite recently 03/02/2015, and we are limited on resources (computers, people, etc.), we are not going to be making progress for some time, and our product may be faulty, have errors, and be buggy. Therefore, as of now, we can make no garuntees about our products.</p>
		<small>The Python file is still under contruction, so please check back later.</small>
