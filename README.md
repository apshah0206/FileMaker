# FileMaker
Software written in Python that allows the user to spawn files. To see a beta version of this document spawned using FileMaker, check out [README.html](https://github.com/apshah0206/FileMaker/blob/master/README.html).

## Our Vision
We want to eventually make a set of scripts that allow the user to ultimatly create any type of file: from simple text, to a working code model.

## Versions
Since we started quite recently (3/2/15), we only currently have 1 release that works: [FileMaker_HTML_1.0](https://github.com/apshah0206/FileMaker/blob/master/FileMaker_HTML_1.0.py). This is a _very_ basic release, only allowing the user to append Headers and Paragraphs to the document.

## Operating systems
FileMaker will run on any operating system that runs python. To run filemaker, simply run the FileMaker program, or type `python` in your terminal, and proceed that way.
